This indicators are saved in a file which name is formed by the name of the matching algorithm concatenated with ".Summary.csv". This file is saved in a folder by the name of "Results" in the same folder where the fingerprints are stored. Two more files are saved, one file containing the false fingerprint matches and the other containing the false not matches.

                    The performance indicators computed in this experiments are: EER(%), FMR100(%), FMR1000(%), ZeroFMR(%), Time(ms) and ROC curves. This indicators are saved in a file which name is formed by the name of the matching algorithm concatenated with ".Summary.csv". This file is saved in a folder by the name of "Results" in the same folder where the fingerprints are stored. Two more files are saved, one file containing the false matching fingerprints and the other containing the false not matching fingerprints.
